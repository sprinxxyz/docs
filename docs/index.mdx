<br />
Sprinx is the trailblazer of the next-generation automated market makers (AMM). Seeking inspiration from leading DeFi protocols such as Curve, Convex and Uniswap, our protocol has been meticulously crafted to serve as the heart of Somnia's liquidity dynamics. At Sprinx, we believe rapidity breeds success which is why we have infused our technical architecture with a robust flywheel mechanism.

This defining feature empowers protocols to build extensive liquidity pools while optimizing on capital efficiency by aligning $SPX emissions. Witness liquidity creation like never before, only on Sprinx protocol - your DeFi paragon in the ve(3,3) domain.

## How it works

Sprinx has created a sustainable system that rewards all participants who contribute to its operation. This includes protocols, veSPX voters, liquidity providers and traders.

- **Protocols** - Offer incentives to veSPX voters to attract votes / SPX emissions to their pools, allowing them to build liquidity at a low cost.
  
- **veSPX Voters** - Vote on which pools will earn SPX emissions and receive 100% of incentives and fees for the pools they vote for. Any SPX holder can lock their tokens to convert to veSPX.
  
- **Liquidity Providers** - Deposit the tokens used for trading on Sprinx and receive SPX emissions as rewards.
  
- **Traders** - Swap tokens with minimal slippage and pay some of the lowest fees to veSPX voters.
